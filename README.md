Just some configs for my monitors and other important stuff like raw mouse acceleration (for gaming mostly).
I created this repo for myself, and it is public because I can just git clone it on a new installation of Linux (if I switch from Arch).

I am also using it to switch back and forth from GPU passthrough. I play some games on a Windows VM that don't run as well on Linux (e.g., cod bo2 is kinda stuttery for me). Some games work better on Linux, and others work better on Windows /shrug
